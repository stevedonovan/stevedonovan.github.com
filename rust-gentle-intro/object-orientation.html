<p>Everyone comes from somewhere, and the chances are good that your previous programming language
implemented Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in a particular way:</p>
<ul>
<li>'classes' act as factories for generating <em>objects</em> (often called <em>instances</em>)
and define unique types.</li>
<li>Classes may <em>inherit</em> from other classes (their <em>parents</em>), inheriting both data (<em>fields</em>)
and behaviour (<em>methods</em>)</li>
<li>If B inherits from A, then an instance of B can be passed to something expecting A
(<em>subtyping</em>)</li>
<li>An object should hide its data (<em>encapsulation</em>), which can only be operated on
with methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Object-oriented <em>design</em> is then about identifying the classes (the 'nouns') and the methods
(the 'verbs') and then establishing relationships between them, <em>is-a</em> and <em>has-a</em>.</p>
<p>There was a point in the old Star Trek series where the doctor would say to the captain,
&quot;It's Life, Jim, just not Life as we know it&quot;. And this applies very much to Rust-flavoured
object-orientation: it comes as a shock, because Rust data aggregates (structs, enums
and tuples) are dumb. You can define methods on them, and make the data itself private,
all the usual tactics of encapsulation, but they are all <em>unrelated types</em>.
There is no subtyping and no inheritance of data.</p>
<p>The relationships between various data types in Rust are
established using <em>traits</em>.  A large part of learning Rust is understanding how the
standard library traits operate, because that's the web of meaning that glues all the
data types together.</p>
<p>Traits are interesting because there's no one-to-one correspondence between them and concepts
from mainstream languages. It depends if you're thinking dynamically or statically. In the
dynamic case, they're rather like Java or Go interfaces.</p>
<p>For instance,  it becomes automatic to slap a <code>#[derive(Debug)]</code>
on any new types, because the innards of those types can be printed out using <code>{:?}</code>. All
stdlib types implement <code>Debug</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
# 
#fn main() {
let question = &quot;everything&quot;;
let answer = 42;

let debugables: Vec&lt;&amp;Debug&gt; = vec![&amp;question,&amp;answer];
for d in &amp;debugables {
    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;,d);
}
// &quot;everything&quot;
// 42

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Now, we could just use <code>{:?}</code> to dump the innards of the vector directly, but I want
to emphasize we are iterating over references that are all guaranteed to have the <code>fmt</code>
method defined. A vector of references to values implementing <code>Debug</code> can be printed out.
That's a clunky thing  to say often, so they are called <code>Debug</code> <em>trait objects</em>.
Now integers and strings otherwise don't have much in common, but here we've found a common denominator;
they know how to print out their innards.
And this is how you get traditional dynamic dispatch in Rust, because that <code>fmt</code> method
defined by the <code>Debug</code> trait is called as a virtual method.</p>
<p>'virtual' method is a concept that only applies to statically-compiled languages; they are the
<em>default</em> in Java, unless you sternly say <code>final</code>. In a language like Python, the object has
all of its class information attached, and the interpreter will look up <code>fmt</code> in the class
object at runtime.</p>
<p>A little refinement of this example - we <em>box</em> the values. A box contains a reference to data
allocated on the heap, and acts very much like a reference - it's a <em>smart pointer</em>. When boxes
go out of scope and <code>Drop</code> kicks in, then that memory is released.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
# 
#fn main() {
    let question = Box::new(&quot;everything&quot;);
    let answer = Box::new(42);

    let debugables: Vec&lt;Box&lt;Debug&gt;&gt; = vec![question,answer];
    for d in &amp;debugables {
        println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;,d);
    }

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The difference is that you can take this vector, pass it as a reference, give it away, without
having to track any borrowed references. When the vector is dropped, the boxes will be dropped,
and all memory is reclaimed.</p>
<a class="header" href="./object-orientation.html#animals" name="animals"><h2>Animals</h2></a>
<p>For some reason, any discussion of OOP and inheritance seems to end up talking about animals. It
makes for a nice story: &quot;See, a Cat is a Carnivore. And a Carnivore is an Animal&quot;. But I'll start
with a classic slogan from the Ruby universe: &quot;if it quacks, it's a duck&quot;. All your objects have
to do is define <code>quack</code> and they can be considered to be ducks, albeit in a very narrow way.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
# 
#fn main() {

trait Quack {
    fn quack(&amp;self);
}

struct Duck ();

impl Quack for Duck {
    fn quack(&amp;self) {
        println!(&quot;quack!&quot;);
    }
}

struct RandomBird {
    is_a_parrot: bool
}

impl Quack for RandomBird {
    fn quack(&amp;self) {
        if ! self.is_a_parrot {
            println!(&quot;quack!&quot;);
        } else {
            println!(&quot;squawk!&quot;);
        }
    }
}

let duck1 = Duck();
let duck2 = RandomBird{is_a_parrot: false};
let parrot = RandomBird{is_a_parrot: true};

let ducks: Vec&lt;&amp;Quack&gt; = vec![&amp;duck1,&amp;duck2,&amp;parrot];

for d in &amp;ducks {
    d.quack();
}
// quack!
// quack!
// squawk!

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here we have two completely different types (one is so dumb it doesn't even have data), and yes,
they all <code>quack()</code>. One is behaving a little odd (for a duck) but they share the same method name
and Rust can keep a collection of such objects in a type-safe way.</p>
<p>Rust is a little over-obsessed with memory safety (since that's the <em>big thing</em> it brings to
system languages) but type safety is a fantastic thing.  Without static typing, you might insert
a <em>cat</em> into that collection of Quackers, resulting in run-time chaos.</p>
<p>Here's a funny one:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
# 
#fn main() {
// and why the hell not!
impl Quack for i32 {
    fn quack(&amp;self) {
        for i in 0..*self {
            print!(&quot;quack {} &quot;,i);
        }
        println!(&quot;&quot;);
    }
}

let int = 4;

let ducks: Vec&lt;&amp;Quack&gt; = vec![&amp;duck1,&amp;duck2,&amp;parrot,&amp;int];
...
// ...
// quack 0 quack 1 quack 2 quack 3

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>What can I say? It quacks, it must be a duck. What's interesting is that you can apply your traits
to any Rust value, not just 'objects'. (Since <code>quack</code> is passed a reference, there's an explicit
dereference <code>*</code> to get the integer.)</p>
<p>However, you can't do this with a trait and a type from the same crate, so the standard library
cannot be 'monkey patched', which is another piece of Ruby folk practice (and not the most wildly
admired either.)</p>
<p>Up to this point, the trait <code>Quack</code> was behaving very much like a Java interface, and like
modern Java interfaces you can have <em>provided</em> methods which supply a default implementation
if you have implemented the <em>required</em> methods. (The <code>Iterator</code> trait is a good example.)</p>
<p>But, note that traits are not part of the <em>definition</em> of a type and you can define and implement
new traits on any type, subject to the same-crate restriction.</p>
<p>It's possible to pass a reference to any <code>Quack</code> implementor:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
# 
#fn main() {
fn quack_ref (q: &amp;Quack) {
    q.quack();
}

quack_ref(&amp;d);

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>And that's subtyping, Rust-style.</p>
<p>Since we're doing Programming Language Comparisons 101 here, I'll mention that Go has an interesting
take on the quacking business - if there's a Go interface <code>Quack</code>, and a type has a <code>quack</code> method,
then that type satisfies <code>Quack</code> without any need for explicit definition. This also breaks the
baked-into-definition Java model, and allows compile-time duck-typing, at the cost of some
clarity and type-safety.</p>
<p>But there is a problem with duck-typing. One of the signs of bad OOP is too many methods which have some
generic name like <code>run</code>. &quot;If it has run(), it must be Runnable&quot; doesn't sound so catchy as
the original!  So it is possible for a Go interface to be <em>accidentally</em> valid. In Rust,
both the <code>Debug</code> and <code>Display</code> traits define <code>fmt</code> methods, but they really mean different
things.</p>
<p>So Rust traits allow traditional <em>polymorphic</em> OOP.  But what about inheritance? People usually
mean <em>implementation inheritance</em> whereas Rust does <em>interface inheritance</em>.  It's as if a Java
programmer never used <code>extend</code> and instead used <code>implements</code>. And this is actually
<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073649/core-java/why-extends-is-evil.html">recommended practice</a>
by Alan Holub. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I once attended a Java user group meeting where James Gosling (Java's inventor) was the featured
speaker. During the memorable Q&amp;A session, someone asked him: &quot;If you could do Java over again,
what would you change?&quot; &quot;I'd leave out classes,&quot; he replied. After the laughter died down,
he explained that the real problem wasn't classes per se, but rather implementation inheritance
(the extends relationship). Interface inheritance (the implements relationship) is preferable.
You should avoid implementation inheritance whenever possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So even in Java, you've probably been doing it wrong!</p>
<p>Implementation inheritance has some serious problems. But it does feel so very
<em>convenient</em>. There's this fat base class called <code>Animal</code> and it has loads of useful
functionality (it may even expose its innards!) which our derived class <code>Cat</code> can use. That is,
it is a form of code reuse. But code reuse is a separate concern.</p>
<a class="header" href="./object-orientation.html#ducks-and-generics" name="ducks-and-generics"><h2>Ducks and Generics</h2></a>
<p>An example of generic-friendly duck function in Rust would be this trivial one:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
# 
#fn main() {
fn quack&lt;Q&gt; (q: &amp;Q)
where Q: Quack {
    q.quack();
}

let d = Duck();
quack(&amp;d);

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The type parameter is <em>any</em> type which implements <code>Quack</code>. There's an important difference
between <code>quack</code> and <code>quack_ref</code>.  The body of this function is compiled for <em>each</em> of the calling
types and no virtual method is needed; such functions can be completely inlined. It
uses the trait <code>Quack</code> in a different way, as a <em>constraint</em> on generic types.</p>
<p>This is the C++ equivalent to the generic <code>quack</code> (note the <code>const</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">template &lt;class Q&gt;
void quack(const Q&amp; q) {
    q.quack();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the type parameter is not constrained in any way.</p>
<p>This is very much compile-time duck-typing - if we pass a reference to a
non-quackable type, then the compiler will complain bitterly about no <code>quack</code> method.
At least the error is found at compile-time, but it's worse when a type is accidentally
Quackable, as happens with Go. More involved template functions and classes lead to
terrible error messages, because there are <em>no</em> constraints on the generic types.</p>
<p>You could define a function which could handle an iteration over Quacker pointers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">template &lt;class It&gt;
void quack_everyone (It start, It finish) {
    for (It i = start; i != finish; i++) {
        (*i)-&gt;quack();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This would then be implemented for <em>each</em> iterator type <code>It</code>.
The Rust equivalent is a little more challenging:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
# 
#fn main() {
fn quack_everyone &lt;I&gt; (iter: I)
where I: Iterator&lt;Item=Box&lt;Quack&gt;&gt; {
    for d in iter {
        d.quack();
    }
}

let ducks: Vec&lt;Box&lt;Quack&gt;&gt; = vec![Box::new(duck1),Box::new(duck2),Box::new(parrot),Box::new(int)];

quack_everyone(ducks.into_iter());

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>Iterators in Rust aren't duck-typed but are types that must implement <code>Iterator</code>, and in
this case the iterator provides boxes of <code>Quack</code>.  There's no ambiguity about the types
involved, and the values must satisfy <code>Quack</code>. Often the function signature is the most challenging
thing about a generic Rust function, which is why I recommend reading the source - the
implementation is often much simpler. Here the only type parameter is the actual iterator type,
which means that this will work with anything that can deliver a sequence of boxes, not just
a vector iterator.</p>
<a class="header" href="./object-orientation.html#inheritance" name="inheritance"><h2>Inheritance</h2></a>
<p>A common problem with object-oriented design is trying to force things into a <em>is-a</em> relationship,
and neglecting <em>has-a</em> relationships. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">GoF</a>
said &quot;Prefer Composition to Inheritance&quot; in their Design Patterns book, twenty-two years ago.</p>
<p>Here's an example: you want to model the employees of some company, and <code>Employee</code> seems a good
name for a class.  Then, Manager is-a Employee (this is true) so we start building our
hierarchy with a <code>Manager</code> subclass of <code>Employee</code>. This isn't as smart as it seems. Maybe we got
carried away with identifying important Nouns, maybe we (unconsciously) think that managers and
employees are different kinds of animals?  It's better for <code>Employee</code> to has-a <code>Roles</code> collection,
and then a manager is just an <code>Employee</code> with more responsibilities and capabilities.</p>
<p>Or consider Vehicles - ranging from bicycles to 300t ore trucks. There are multiple ways to think
about vehicles, road-worthiness (all-terrain, city, rail-bound, etc), power-source (electric,
diesel, diesel-electric, etc), cargo-or-people, and so forth.  Any fixed hierarchy of classes
you create based on one aspect ignores all other aspects. That is, there are multiple possible
classifications of vehicles!</p>
<p>Composition is more important in Rust for the obvious reason that you can't inherit functionality
in a lazy way from the base class.</p>
<p>But there is <em>trait inheritance</em>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
# 
#fn main() {
trait Show {
    fn show(&amp;self) -&gt; String;
}

trait Location {
    fn location(&amp;self) -&gt; String;
}

trait ShowTell: Show + Location {}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>The last trait simply combines our two distinct traits into one, although it can specify
other methods.</p>
<p>Things now proceed as before:</p>
<pre><code>#[derive(Debug)]
struct Foo {
    name: String,
    location: String
}

impl Foo {
    fn new(name: &amp;str, location: &amp;str) -&gt; Foo {
        Foo{
            name: name.to_string(),
            location: location.to_string()
        }
    }
}

impl Show for Foo {
    fn show(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        self.name.clone()
    }
}

impl Location for Foo {
    fn location(&amp;self) -&gt; String {
        self.location.clone()
    }
}

impl ShowTell for Foo {}

</code></pre>
<p>Now, if I have a value <code>foo</code> of type <code>Foo</code>, then a reference to that value will
satisfy <code>&amp;Show</code>, <code>&amp;Location</code> or <code>&amp;ShowTell</code> (which implies both.)</p>
<p>Here's a useful little macro:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
# 
#fn main() {
macro_rules! dbg {
    ($x:expr) =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;{} = {:?}&quot;,stringify!($x),$x);
    }
}

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>It takes one argument (represented by <code>$x</code>) which must be an 'expression'. We print out its
value, and a <em>stringified</em> version of the value. C programmers can be a <em>little</em> smug at this point,
but this means that if I passed <code>1+2</code> (an expression) then <code>stringify!(1+2)</code> is the literal
string &quot;1+2&quot;. This will save us some typing when playing with code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
# 
#fn main() {
let foo = Foo::new(&quot;Pete&quot;,&quot;bathroom&quot;);
dbg!(foo.show());
dbg!(foo.location());

let st: &amp;ShowTell = &amp;foo;

dbg!(st.show());
dbg!(st.location());

fn show_it_all(r: &amp;ShowTell) {
    dbg!(r.show());
    dbg!(r.location());
}

let boo = Foo::new(&quot;Alice&quot;,&quot;cupboard&quot;);
show_it_all(&amp;boo);

fn show(s: &amp;Show) {
    dbg!(s.show());
}

show(&amp;boo);

// foo.show() = &quot;Pete&quot;
// foo.location() = &quot;bathroom&quot;
// st.show() = &quot;Pete&quot;
// st.location() = &quot;bathroom&quot;
// r.show() = &quot;Alice&quot;
// r.location() = &quot;cupboard&quot;
// s.show() = &quot;Alice&quot;

#}</code></pre></pre>
<p>This <em>is</em> object-orientation, just not the kind you may be used to.</p>
<p>Please note that the <code>Show</code> reference passed to <code>show</code> can not be <em>dynamically</em>
upgraded to a <code>ShowTell</code>!  Languages with more dynamic class systems allow you to
check whether a given object is an instance of a class and then to do a
dynamic cast to that type. It isn't really a good idea in general, and specifically
cannot work in Rust because that <code>Show</code> reference has 'forgotten' that it was originally
a <code>ShowTell</code> reference.</p>
<p>Composition is also important in Rust because the borrow checker is smart enough
to know that borrowing different struct fields are separate borrows. You can have
a mutable borrow of one field while having an immutable borrow of another field,
and so forth. Rust cannot tell that a method only accesses one field, so the
fields should be structs with their own methods for implementation convenience.
(The <em>external</em> interface of the struct can be anything you like using suitable traits.)</p>
<p>You always have a choice: polymorphic, via trait objects, or monomorphic, via generics
constrainted by traits. Modern C++ and the Rust standard library tends to take the generic
route, but the polymorphic route is not obselete. You do have to understand the different
trade-offs - generics generate the fastest code, which can be inlined. This may lead
to code bloat. But not everything needs to be as <em>fast as possible</em> - it may only happen
a 'few' times in the lifetime of a typical program fun.</p>
<a class="header" href="./object-orientation.html#example-windows-api" name="example-windows-api"><h2>Example: Windows API</h2></a>
<p>One of the areas where traditional OOP is used extensively is GUI toolkits. An EditControl or a ListWindow
is-a Window, and so forth. This makes writing Rust bindings to GUI toolkits more difficult
than it needs to be.</p>
<p>Win32 programming can be done <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/1053658/Win-GUI-Programming-In-Rust-Language">directly</a>
in Rust, and it's a little less awkward than the original C. As soon as I graduated from C
to C++ I wanted something cleaner and did my own OOP wrapper.</p>
<p>A typical Win32 API function is <a href="https://docs.rs/user32-sys/0.0.9/i686-pc-windows-gnu/user32_sys/fn.ShowWindow.html">ShowWindow</a>
which is used to control the visibility of a window. Now, an <code>EditControl</code> has some specialized
functionality, but it's all done with a Win32 <code>HWND</code> ('handle to window') opaque value.
You would like <code>EditControl</code> to also have a <code>show</code> method, which traditionally would be done
by implementation inheritance. You <em>not</em> want to have to type out all these inherited methods
for each type! But Rust traits provide a solution. There would be a <code>Window</code> trait:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust"># #![allow(unused_variables)]
# 
#fn main() {
trait Window {
    // you need to define this!
    fn get_hwnd(&amp;self) -&gt; HWND;

    // and all these will be provided
    fn show(&amp;self, visible: bool) {
        unsafe {
         user32_sys::ShowWindow(self.get_hwnd(), if visible {1} else {0})
        }
    }

    // ..... oodles of methods operating on Windows

<p>So, the implementation struct for <code>EditControl</code> can just contain a <code>HWND</code> and implement <code>Window</code>
by defining one method; <code>EditControl</code> is a trait that inherits from <code>Window</code> and defines the extended
interface.  Something like <code>ComboxBox</code> - which behaves like an <code>EditControl</code> <em>and</em> a
<code>ListWindow</code> can be easily implemented with trait inheritance.</p>
<p>The Win32 API ('32' no longer means '32-bit' anymore) is in fact object-oriented, but an
older style, influenced by Alan Kay's definition: objects contain hidden data, and are operated
on by <em>messages</em>. So at the heart of any Windows application there's a message loop, and
the various kinds of windows (called 'window classes') implement these methods with their
own switch statements.  There is a message called <code>WM_SETTEXT</code> but the implementation can be
different: a label's text changes, but a top-level window's caption changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://gabdube.github.io/native-windows-gui/book_20.html">Here</a> is a rather promising
minimal Windows GUI framework. But to my taste, there are too many <code>unwrap</code> instances
going on - and some of them aren't even errors. This is because NWG is exploiting the
loose dynamic nature of messaging.  With a proper type-safe interface, more errors are
caught at compile-time.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/book/second-edition/ch17-00-oop.html">next edition</a>
of The Rust Programming Language book has a very good discussion on what 'object-oriented'
means in Rust.</p>
